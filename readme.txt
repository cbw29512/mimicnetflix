Skilled React assignment

Background
This document outlines the homework assignment for the Skilled React class. 
What are we building?
We want to mimic Netflix’s UI. They have these 3 rows which are all movie titles for browsing but each row has posters of different sizes and aspect ratios:



Our finished product is gonna be much simpler looking. We will use divs with a background color instead of images.

Each of the 3 rows above have the same functionality (you can scroll horizontally) but the sizes of the children (posters) within them is different. Re-create this as best as you can in terms of functionality (colors of the divs don’t matter so much, for example).


Grading
While you want to get as close to the mocks as you can, focus on functionality and re-usability of components in your code. Do not worry about styling or css (but do try to keep it clean). If you are spending more than 2-3 hours on this exercise, you are probably overthinking it. 

Submitting you code
I would like two things from you. 1) Your application should be hosted somewhere. You can use something like CodeSandbox or anything else that is similar. As long as I can see and interact with your application, it’s all good. 2) Send me your code. If you use CodeSandbox or a similar solution, I can just see your code. Github is an acceptable alternate solution for hosting your code.


Helpers
For context, these are the color values I have used in my demo:

Top Row: ["#03045e", "#023e8a", "#0077b6", "#0096c7", "#00b4d8", "#48cae4", "#90e0ef", "#ade8f4", "#caf0f8"]
Middle Row:  ["#ffadad", "#ffd6a5", "#fdffb6", "#caffbf", "#9bf6ff", "#a0c4ff", "#bdb2ff",  "#ffc6ff"];
Bottom Row: [ "#03071e", "#370617", "#6a040f", "#9d0208", "#d00000", "#dc2f02", "#e85d04", "#f48c06", "#faa307",  "#ffba08"];
You can start with create-react-app to setup an app or use an online environment like CodeSanbox.
